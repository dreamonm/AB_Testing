# Fast-Food Chain Marketing Campaign Evaluation

The dataset utilized in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. 
This dataset includes sales data collected from a fast-food chain's initiative to introduce a new menu item in various locations. 
The aim of the experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of three distinct marketing campaigns in promoting the new product.

The scenario behind this data is that a fast-food chain is planning to enhance its menu by introducing a new item to attract customers and increase sales. However, the challenge lies in selecting the most effective marketing campaign to promote this new addition. The chain is considering three different marketing strategies and must decide which one will have the most significant impact on sales.

To make this decision, an empirical strategy is implemented in each of the three marketing campaigns in different locations within several randomly selected markets. This approach will enable the collection of weekly sales data for the new item during the initial four weeks of its launch. This data-driven approach will help to determine which marketing campaign is the most successful in driving sales.
